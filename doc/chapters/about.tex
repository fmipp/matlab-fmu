\section{About}

This toolbox for \matlab provides the full functionality of the \fmipp library on Windows.
It supports the following features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item import of FMUs for ModelExchange (FMI~v1.0 and FMI~v2.0) into \matlab scripts
  \item import of FMUs for Co-Simulation (FMI~v1.0 and FMI~v2.0) into \matlab scripts
  \item export of MATLAB scripts as FMUs for Co-Simulation (FMI~v1.0 and FMI~v2.0)
\end{itemize}
In contrast to other FMI-related toolboxes for \matlab, the \fmipp \matlab Toolbox is not restricted to importing FMUs into \simulink models or exporting FMUs from \simulink models.
Rather, it allows to use the full range of functionality provided by \matlab.
